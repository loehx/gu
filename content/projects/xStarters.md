description: An independently organized department of Volkswagen wants to launch a campaign to help kids between 14 and 19 to increase digital skills, like programming, design and business. Kids can sign up and find teams to master challenges and win prizes. A website informs kids, parents and teachers about the campaign, an admin interface lets the xStarters team at VW guide the teams while solving quests and manage things, like users, teams and challenge contents. The main focus lies on the Android- and iOS-App, that contains most of the features to compete with other teams to win a challenge, such as signup, team-finding, team-chat, quests.
